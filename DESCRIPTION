Title: Enhanced Assignment Operator to Overwrite or Grow Objects
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Antoine Fabri
Maintainer: Antoine Fabri <antoine.fabri@gmail.com>
Description:
    Use '..' on the right hand side of the ':=' operator as a shorthand for the 
    left hand side, so that 'var := f(..) + ..' is equivalent to
    'var <- f(var) + var'. This permits the user to be explicit about growing an
    object or overwriting it using its previous value, avoids repeating a 
    variable name, and saves keystrokes, time, visual space and cognitive load.
