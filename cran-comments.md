"please use only undirected quotation marks ('...' or "...") in your Description text"
backticks were changed to simple quotes

## Responding to the pretest checks 2019-03-09
* I believe that the NOTE is because it's my first package submission
* I added package htmltools to "Suggests", which will hopefully take care of
the win-builder warning on windows
